        <p>Hi! I am Cristine and I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I’ve been living in London with my husband and children for about a week now. 
            I don't have a hobby, but I like to draw and read when I have time.</p>
            
        <p> I studied visual communication at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, there I learned a lot about graphic design and a little about motion and animation. 
            During my academic studies, my main interest became solving real visual communication problems for people. 
            This has always been my challenge and my motivation when working at COBRAPE, an engineering company specializing in projects for cities and communities. 
            The company has a highly technical team that often had difficulty communicating with an audience that knew very little about water quality and sewage treatment.
            After working about 10 years there I start to study UI design and I decided to switch from paper to a digital platform. 
            I hope to learn how to be a good front-end developer.</p>
