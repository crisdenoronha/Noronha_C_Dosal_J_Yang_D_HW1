            <h2>About me</h2>
            <body>I would like to share my working experience with you. Now, I am studying in Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. 
                Before as an education consultant, I worked as a copywriter for more than three years, including part-time jobs in college and freelance writing.
                I like writing which helps me express my real idea and does not hurt others. Besides, writing is very silent and is a very powerful tool in many situations.
                 I insisted that I would be a very excellent copywriter one day. However, my career goal has changed because of my educational experiences. 
                 I decided to apply to a oversee university of college because I would like to experience a fresh environment. I spent many years studying English and applying 
                 to universities. During that time, I met different kinds of friends who wanted to go to an overseas university, but some of them gave up because they were afraid 
                 of hard studying English for a long time. In the end, I applied to Blinn College in Texas. I studied Business as a part-time form for more than one year. 
                However, I found I was fond of media and relative things. I decided to transfer my credits to Interactive Media Design. I chose this major 
                because I thought interactive media design can be used in many field. Besides, I worked in a media company and knew what design was. 
                I had confidence to study the major well and would get a good job.
                As for my experience, I did not forget how to write the advertisement text and I also knew how to make the picture pretty. 
                Although the copywriter was different from the designer, I did not feel confused but exciting because I enjoyed in design field. 
                
                At present, my career goal is to be a good web designer. If I am good at code, I am willing to be a web developer. 
                I want to get into a fresh field which means I can develop my working skills. 
                If you have any questions about me, you can contact me.

        <h1>Cristine Galvão de Noronha</h1>
        <h2>presentation</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Cristine and I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I’ve been living in London with my husband and children for about a week now. 
            I don't have a hobby, but I like to draw and read when I have time.</p>
            
        <p> I studied visual communication at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, there I learned a lot about graphic design and a little about motion and animation. 
            During my academic studies, my main interest became solving real visual communication problems for people. 
            This has always been my challenge and my motivation when working at COBRAPE, an engineering company specializing in projects for cities and communities. 
            The company has a highly technical team that often had difficulty communicating with an audience that knew very little about water quality and sewage treatment.
            After working about 10 years there I start to study UI design and I decided to switch from paper to a digital platform. 
            I hope to learn how to be a good front-end developer.</p>
