            <h2>About me</h2>
            <body>I would like to share my working experience with you. Now, I am studying in Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. 
                Before as an education consultant, I worked as a copywriter for more than three years, including part-time jobs in college and freelance writing.
                I like writing which helps me express my real idea and does not hurt others. Besides, writing is very silent and is a very powerful tool in many situations.
                 I insisted that I would be a very excellent copywriter one day. However, my career goal has changed because of my educational experiences. 
                 I decided to apply to a oversee university of college because I would like to experience a fresh environment. I spent many years studying English and applying 
                 to universities. During that time, I met different kinds of friends who wanted to go to an overseas university, but some of them gave up because they were afraid 
                 of hard studying English for a long time. In the end, I applied to Blinn College in Texas. I studied Business as a part-time form for more than one year. 
                However, I found I was fond of media and relative things. I decided to transfer my credits to Interactive Media Design. I chose this major 
                because I thought interactive media design can be used in many field. Besides, I worked in a media company and knew what design was. 
                I had confidence to study the major well and would get a good job.
                As for my experience, I did not forget how to write the advertisement text and I also knew how to make the picture pretty. 
                Although the copywriter was different from the designer, I did not feel confused but exciting because I enjoyed in design field. 
                
                At present, my career goal is to be a good web designer. If I am good at code, I am willing to be a web developer. 
                I want to get into a fresh field which means I can develop my working skills. 
                If you have any questions about me, you can contact me.
